## Lore

Penny is the mayor of her own town, Pennyton, which was founded to help house homeless displaced after the Convergence. After being captured once by Nolok, Penny trained herself to be just as competent an adventurer as Tux so that she would not only not be taken so easily again, but also able to help Tux if Nolok were to return. She is very intelligent and business-savy, making her good at managing her town, which she hopes to expand and provide affordable living for more people over the years.

## Meta

Penny is not a mascot, but was created as a Peach ersatz for OG SuperTux.

\* Penny's height varies with each presentaion. In STA, heights are derived from sprite height, using a scale of 7 pixels per foot.
