# SuperTux Advance Timeline

Sections marked NGO stand for Non-Game Origin, meaning they take place outside of any games.

## Pre-Tux (NGO)

In an alternate version of our own Earth, on the continent of Australia, the fairy penguins lived peacefully for many years. Then, one fateful day, the warlord warlock, Nolok the Crocodile, conquered the land and forced the penguins into his service.

## Pingus

The penguins heard of a far-away land where penguins of all kinds lived in freedom. Peparing for a long journey and stealing the tools they once used to work for Nolok, they began their long pilgrimage across the world.

Eventually, they found their way to Antarctica, and settled down on Icy Island. Among them were born two special penguins, Tux and Penny. They were also introduced to the favorite sport of the native Antarctic penguins: snow racing.

## Extreme Tux Racer

Over the years, Tux and Penny proved themselves to the flock. Penny was in line to become the flock leader, while Tux was becoming an incredibly competent snow racer, even able to keep up with the larger penguin species. It wouldn't be long before Tux and Penny caught each other's eyes, and love soon followed.

## Kyrodian Legends

Meanwhile, on the distant planet of Kyroda, Midi Waffle was being raised by the pirate faction known as the Cold Front. As he trained his bomb magic, he eventually found the courage to escape the pirates and work against them as a bounty hunter, along with new friends.

After defeating the Cold Front's leader, Emperor Pendragon, Midi and his team, the Cloud Chasers, went on to be very successful hunters, until the day he and others from worlds apart were destined to cross paths.

## Surge the Rabbit

On another planet, the dark wizard Gimacian had launched a campaign to conquer his world. He was thwarted by an electric speed demon by the name of Surge, a rabbit who could absorb and control electricity to boost is abilities.

Surge had just defeated Gamacian and freed the animals the wizard was capturing when their world was suddenly shaken by an unknown force. The two foes were torn from their world, along with others. While Gamacian's fate was unknown, Surge found himself the prisoner of a mysterious new army.

## SuperTux

Tux and Penny had been growing closer and closer. One day, they went to have a picnic together. Unbeknownst to them, Nolok had tracked the penguins down, and had been preparing to get revenge on them for abandoning him. He captured Penny, leaving an injured Tux to his fate. Tux was able to recover, and set out on a quest to rescue Penny.

Along the way, they discovered the Ghost Tree within a corrupted forest. Tux was able to kill the tree, but Nolok kept a piece of it and fused it with a Hero Crystal to create the Ghost Scepter. While he was defeated by Tux, the misuse of the Ghost Tree's power had rippling effects across the multiverse.

## Yggdrasil (NGO)

The tree of the multiverse, Yggdrasil, is a very special organism. Thought once to connect to only a handful of worlds, the tree infact connects to countless worlds across the multiverse, and is suspected not to be the only one of its kind.

Yggdrasil supports itself by feeding on cosmic radiation, absorbing and metabolizing light cosmic energy, and outputting dark cosmic energy, similar to how a tree takes in CO2, uses the carbon, and releases the oxygen. In this case, the byproduct is released into other worlds to be used by dark-powered beings, for example, the Ghost Trees.

Ghost Trees are known to infect or "corrupt" other life forms and turn them into harvesters to help them gather even more dark energy. If one of them dies, Yggdrasil will redirect its dark output, further boosting the power of other Ghost Trees.

The death of a Ghost Tree will cause a second reaction in Yggdrasil: diverting dark energy causes it to also temporarily link multiple worlds together, which may cause the displacement of lifeforms from one world to another. Such an event is what resulted from Tux and Nolok interfering with the Ghost Tree on alter Earth.

## SuperTux Advance

Following the Convergence, Penny and Tux moved to the Aurora Isles to found a new town where they could house displaced who hadn't found new homes. Nolok, furious at being foiled by Tux, decided to take revenge once again, this time by abducting the people Penny had tried to help.

Penny and Tux set out together to rescue their friends, along the way meeting heroes from other worlds, including Midi and Surge, as well as friends from around their own world like Konqi and Kiki.

Together, the team tracked down their abducted friends and defeated Nolok once again. With all seeming well, they returned home while continuing to search for a way to return the displaced to their own worlds.

Shorty after Nolok's defeat, a new warrior appeared in Tux's world, seeking the help of Tux and his friends.

## Open Source of Power

Cyra, one of the Guardians of Yggdrasil, warned Tux and friends about the threat of a multiversal conqurer named Tivoverlord who was looking to turn their world into another part of his empire. Upon hearing this, even Nolok joined the fight, but only because he didn't want anyone else ruling his world.

Being joined by other warriors from across the multiverse, Cyra led the charge against Tivoverlord, eventually defeating the tyrant and liberating the worlds connected to Yggdrasil from his power.

As thanks for their help, Sue, the deity of order, offered transport to the displaced by connecting their worlds with stable portals. As the worlds had already been exposed to each other by natural means, they were allowed to stay conencted, letting people from different worlds visit Tux's whenever they pleased.

## SuperTuxKart

After the craziness with Tivoverlord, Nolok decided he needed a break from dealing with world-shattering powers. Still finding Tux and his friends despicable, he took a more petty approach to tormenting them, this time capturing Gnu and threatening to eat him if the others couldn't beat him at kart racing.

Tux and friends took part in a grand prix to determine who would be fast enough to challenge Nolok and save Gnu from a dinner date to die for.

## Tux!

Years after his battles with Nolok, Tux settles down with Penny and has a family. He still has one more adventure to go on: gathering lots of fish to feed his flock.
