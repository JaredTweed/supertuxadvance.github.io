## Translation contribution

SuperTux Advance needs your help with translation! You can update or create translations in languages you know to help the game be more reachable.

[View current translations](https://github.com/KelvinShadewing/supertux-advance/tree/main/lang){:target="_blank"} and [download](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4604663/download-single-files-from-github){:target="_blank"} one, if you want to update it.

### Tip!
You can use [SuperTux Advance Translator](https://vankata453.github.io/sta-translator/){:target="_blank"} to translate more conveniently. This is not required, but it can simplify the process and is always updated with the newest available lines for translation in English. You can import existing translations to update as well.

### Finishing
If you have finished creating or improving a translation, you can contribute it in two ways:

1. Choose a method to [contact us](/contact) with and send us the `.json` file directly.
2.
